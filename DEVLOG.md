# TODO

### EXPANSION_UNLOCKED Page

  * Spend ApproveAll to sell existing Alchemistresses prior to Mint()
* Comm()
  * Timer
  * Close on Timer
* Withdraw()
  * After Timer is up.
* SetTokenURI()
* ReadBalance Function that is accurate and tells the difference between ETH from Comms and ETH from Mints

## React Hooks

* How many Membership Shares exist in the TBAs of Alchemistresses?
* What is the balance of currently funded contracts minus comms?
  * Does that balance accurately represent itself on gauges?
* How much time is left in the campaign before comms close?
* Withdraw Page could use deBank API for Token Balances | NFT Balances
